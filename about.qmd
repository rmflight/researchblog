## The Blog

This is a place for me to share analysis tips and tricks, musings on open and reproducible science, as well as recent publications, and whatever is on my mind.
You are likely to find personal analysis projects, as well as my musings on R code and different types of algorithms.

All opinions are my own and do not reflect those of my employer or the university where I work.

## Me

I'm a senior research associate in bioinformatics at the [Moseley Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Lab](https://bioinformatics.cesb.uky.edu/), which is part of the [Markey Cancer Center](https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/markey-cancer-center) at the [University of Kentucky](http://www.uky.edu/). 
I work with our collaborators to analyse a variety of -omics data, including transcriptomics and metabolomics using both previously established and newly developed methods.

I have been analyzing -omics type data since 2004, and programming in R since 2010.
I authored the [categoryCompare](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/categoryCompare.html) Bioconductor package for comparing -omics data using annotations.

You can find my publications (and other research outputs) on my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8141-7788).
