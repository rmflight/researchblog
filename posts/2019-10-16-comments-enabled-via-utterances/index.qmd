  How I got utterances working on blogdown.
---

## TL;DR

[Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is a lightweight commenting platform built
on GitHub issues. So you have to have a GitHub account, but I expect most people
who comment on this blog already have one.

## Why Utterances

When I switched to [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), I lost
my disqus comments. I had considered migrating them over, but never got around
to it. I also thought that there had to be a way to link GitHub issues to
blog posts, but didn't investigate it much.

Then, I came across [MaÃ«lle's blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/) about switching to [utterances](https://uteranc.es)
and I was sold. I had some free time last night, and dived into how to add it
to my site that uses the hugo academic theme.

I'm not expecting a lot of heavy commenting, but at least it's now available!

## How

For blogdown, just replace everything in *layouts/partials/comments.html* with the code snippet from utterances.
