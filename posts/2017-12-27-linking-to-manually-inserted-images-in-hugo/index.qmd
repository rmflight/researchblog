  This is my method to include something manually in a blogdown post.

## Manual Linking?

Using `blogdown` for generating websites and blog-posts from `Rmarkdown` files 
with lots of inserted code and figures
seems pretty awesome, but sometimes you want to include a figure manually, either
because you want to generate something manually and convert it (say
for going from SVG of lots of points to hi-res PNG), or because it is a figure
from something else ([like this figure from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg)).

## Where to??

To do this, you want the text of your `<img>` tag to your image to be: 

```
<img src = "/img/image_file.png"></img>
```

And then put the image itself in the directory `/static/img/image_file.png`

<img src = "/img/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg"></img>

This information is also mentioned in [section 2.7 of the Blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html). Obviously I need to 
do more reading.
