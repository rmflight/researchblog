I've been using GitHub actions to check and test some of my R packages on multiple architectures, which is nice because I work primarily on Linux.

One recent package uses the `{Cairo}` package to generate images that are subsequently used for visualization [@cairopackage].

Interestingly, `{Cairo}` will install fine on MacOS, and then fail as soon as you do `library(Cairo)`, complaining about not being able to load the {cairo.so} file.

Thankfully, it seems that the GitHub actions MacOS VMs have homebrew [@homebrew] installed, which means we can use the xquartz brew [@xquartzbrew] to install it, and have {cairo.so} available.

To add this to your GitHub actions yml, you should add these lines, and double check the brew syntax with the official docs.

```
    steps:
      - name: Install X11 dependencies on MacOS
        if: runner.os == 'macOS'
        run: |
          brew install --cask xquartz
```
