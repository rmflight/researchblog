If you want to change how the date is displayed in your `{quarto}` documents, this is handy.

One, decide **what** [date](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html#date) you want included:

  * now
  * today
  * last-modified (this is my favorite, because I can tell if I've got the most recent version)
  
Then, you can change how the date is displayed using the `date-format`  [option](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html).

My personal preference is for something like 2022-12-08 13:42, to avoid any ambiguity when I'm generating reports for others.

```yaml
---
date: last-modified
date-format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
---
```
